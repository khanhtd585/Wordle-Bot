You are an expert web developer. Your task is to create a modern, interactive Wordle-like web app with the following requirements:

- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- The UI must be clean, responsive, and visually similar to https://wordle.ai/
- Implement a 6x5 grid for guesses, with color-coded feedback (green/yellow/black)
- Allow manual play: user types guesses, selects feedback for each letter
- Show a list of optimal first guesses (entropy or popularity based)
- Implement a bot that can automatically solve the puzzle by:
  - Picking a random first guess from a curated list
  - Calling a public API (e.g., /daily endpoint) to get feedback
  - Filtering possible words and calculating entropy to suggest the next guess
  - Looping until the answer is found or attempts run out
- Visualize all guesses and feedback on the grid
- Add click-to-fill suggestions, reset button, and win notification
- All UI messages and comments must be in English
- Code must be clean, modular, and easy to maintain

Deliver a project with:
- index.html, style.css, script.js, words.js
- README.md with usage and customization instructions
- prompt.txt (this file)

The result should be a beautiful, user-friendly Wordle bot web app that can be run locally in any browser.
